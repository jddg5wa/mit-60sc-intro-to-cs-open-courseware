# Problem Set 1

## Introduction

This problem set is designed to familiarize you with control flow in Python and to formulate computational solutions to problems. The task involves writing three simple Python programs, testing them, and submitting them. Read the instructions carefully before proceeding.

## Problem 1: Minimum Monthly Payment Calculator

Create a Python program that calculates the credit card balance after one year, assuming the minimum monthly payment is made. User inputs outstanding balance, annual interest rate, and minimum monthly payment rate. Program computes monthly payment, interest paid, principal paid, and remaining balance for each month. Display total amount paid over the year and remaining balance, rounded to the nearest penny.

# Problem 2: "Pay Off Debt Within 12 Months"

Design a Python program to find the minimum fixed monthly payment needed to pay off a credit card balance within 12 months. User inputs outstanding balance and annual interest rate. Use bisection search to find the smallest fixed monthly payment, a multiple of $10. Output fixed minimum monthly payment, months needed (up to 12), and final balance (likely negative).

# Problem 3: Efficient Debt Payoff with Bisection Search

Develop a Python program using bisection search to efficiently find the smallest monthly payment (to the cent) required to pay off credit card debt within 12 months. User inputs outstanding balance and annual interest rate. Apply bisection search to narrow payment range. Output monthly payment, months needed (up to 12), and final balance (may be negative).

# ðŸ§©  Problem Set 0

## Introduction

This problem set serves as an introduction to the programming environment IDLE and programming in Python, along with an overview of the general problem set structure. The tasks involve installing IDLE, writing a simple Python program, and submitting it. For collaboration, students can work together, but each student should submit their assignment separately, mentioning their collaborators.

## Accepting User Inputs

The task for Problem 1 is to create a program that performs the following actions in order:

1. Asks the user to enter their date of birth.
2. Asks the user to enter their last name.
3. Prints out the userâ€™s last name and date of birth, in that order.

The program should be designed to take user input, display output, and use variables to store and access values as needed. The submission should include a file named "ps0.py," and at the beginning of the file, students should indicate the time spent on the problem and the names of their collaborators.

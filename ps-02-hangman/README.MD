# ðŸ§© Problem Set #2

## Introduction

Problem Set #2 is focused on successive approximation and a word game implementation. It aims to familiarize you with Newton's method for finding roots of a function through successive approximation. Additionally, you will develop an interactive Hangman game, where the computer randomly selects a word, and the player attempts to guess the word within a limited number of tries.

## Problem 1: Polynomials and Successive Approximation

The first set of problems involves working with polynomials represented as tuples and implementing Newton's method for finding polynomial roots. You will create functions to evaluate polynomials for a given value, compute the derivative of a polynomial, and apply Newton's method to approximate a root of a polynomial function.

## Problem 2: Hangman Game

In this problem, you will design and implement a simple interactive Hangman game. The computer selects a word randomly from a list, and the player guesses letters to reveal the word. The game provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses, displays the partially guessed word, and informs the player about the remaining guesses. Your task is to write the main function for the Hangman game and any necessary helper functions to facilitate the gameplay.

Challenge yourself to efficiently organize the code and make logical subtasks to enhance the overall game structure. Through this problem set, you'll gain experience in coding interactive games, handling strings, and designing interactive user experiences in Python. Don't forget to submit your code files with collaboration and time information. Good luck and have fun!

# MIT Open Courseware Intro to Computer Science 6.00SC: Problem Set Overview

## 📖 Introduction

This document provides a structured overview of the problem sets I tackled during the Computer Science 6.00SC course, as part of the MIT Open Courseware series. Each problem set is summarized to highlight its primary objectives and computational challenges.

Prior to this class I was a growing graphic designer. I took this class in 2014. I followed along this class as a solo learning journey into Computer Science and to grow my ability to build interactivity into my designs.

**Note**: The following descriptions are concise summaries. For comprehensive details and technical instructions, refer to the respective problem set directories.

## 📌 Problem Sets Breakdown

1. **Problem Set 0**: 🖥️
    - An introduction to the Python programming environment and the IDLE interface. It encompasses the foundational principles of Python programming and provides the structure for subsequent problem sets.

2. **Problem Set 2**: 🔢
    - This problem set focuses on numerical approximation techniques, particularly Newton's method. It also includes the implementation of a Hangman game, demonstrating practical application of string manipulation and control structures.

3. **Problem Set 3**: 🎲
    - The primary objective is to design and implement a word game similar to established titles like Scrabble. This problem set emphasizes string operations, data structures, and game logic.

4. **Problem Set 4**: 🔐
    - An exploration into the realm of cryptography, specifically utilizing the Caesar cipher. This set emphasizes the principles of encryption and decryption, character mapping, and algorithmic shifts.

5. **Problem Set 5**: 📰
    - Development of an RSS Feed Filter, a tool to curate and filter news feeds based on user-defined criteria. This set introduces web scraping, data processing, and string matching techniques.

6. **Problem Set 6**: 🤖
    - A simulation framework is constructed to model robotic behavior within a confined space. The primary goal is to determine cleaning efficiency and performance metrics for multiple robots in a shared environment.

7. **Problem Set 7**: 🦠
    - A stochastic simulation modeling the spread of diseases and viral populations. The module underscores the principles of probability, patient dynamics, and epidemiological studies.

8. **Problem Set 8**: 💊
    - A continuation of the previous set, focusing on simulating treatment regimens and the effects on virus dynamics. Emphasis is placed on drug resistance, viral replication rates, and therapeutic strategies.

9. **Problem Set 9**: 📚
    - An optimization challenge requiring the development of algorithms for academic course scheduling. The problem set involves value maximization within constraints, exploring both greedy and brute-force methodologies.

10. **Problem Set 10**: 📊
    - Utilization of the k-means clustering algorithm for data categorization using U.S. Census data. This set provides an introduction to data science principles, cluster analysis, and prediction error evaluations.

# ðŸ§© Problem Set 8: Designing Treatment Plans for Virus Population Dynamics

## Introduction

In Problem Set 8, you will implement a stochastic simulation of patient and virus population dynamics to study treatment plans for virus infections. The simulation involves administering drugs to patients and observing the effects of different treatment regimens on the virus population. The simulation will model the spread of virus particles and their ability to acquire resistance to drugs over time.

The problem set is divided into six parts:

## Part I: Implementing a Simulation With Drugs

In Part I, you will implement a simulation that considers both administering drugs to the patient and the ability of virus particles to acquire drug resistance through mutations. You will introduce a subclass called `ResistantVirus` to represent a virus particle with drug resistance traits and implement its methods for reproduction and drug resistance evaluation.

## Part II: Running and Analyzing a Simulation with a Drug

In Part II, you will run a simulation using the `ResistantVirus` implementation. The simulation will consist of 150 time steps, followed by administering the drug "guttagonol," and then another 150 time steps. You will plot the average total virus population and the average population of guttagonol-resistant virus particles over time and analyze the trends.

## Part III: The Effect of Delaying Treatment on Patient Outcome

Part III explores the effect of delaying drug treatment on patient outcomes. You will run simulations with different time step delays before administering guttagonol to the patient. After observing multiple trials, you will plot histograms of the final virus populations and analyze the percentage of patients cured or in remission based on the delay.

## Part IV: Designing a Treatment Plan with Two Drugs

In Part IV, you will introduce a two-drug treatment approach to address the problem of acquired drug resistance. The simulation will involve administering two independently-acting drugs, guttagonol and grimpex, with different lag times between their administration. You will plot histograms of the final total virus populations for each condition to observe the patient outcomes.

## Part V: Analysis of Virus Population Dynamics with Two Drugs

In Part V, you will analyze the virus population dynamics in more detail. Two individual simulations will be performed to examine the relationship between patient outcomes and the time between administering the two drugs. You will plot the total population and populations of guttagonol-resistant, grimpex-resistant, and both-resistant viruses as functions of time and explain the findings.

## Part VI: Patient Non-compliance

In the final part, you will discuss the common problem of patient non-compliance, where patients may not consistently take prescribed drugs. You will describe how you would model such effects without writing any code.

By completing this problem set, you will gain insights into the dynamics of virus populations and the design of treatment plans using simulation techniques. Enjoy the exploration and happy coding!
